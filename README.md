## Data Analysis of YouTube Travel Vloggers

In this project I conduct some exploratory data analysis on a selection of YouTube videos. I aim to find out if there are any key indicators with a link to the popularity of videos. This interested me as it is a tool that content creators could use during the process of making their videos to improve performance. I explore some potential relationships between variables such as which key features of a video can indictate higher views. The YouTube channels that I choose to analyse were all travel vloggers as these are videos that I was interested at the time of creating the project!
